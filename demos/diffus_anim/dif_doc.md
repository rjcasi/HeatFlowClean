🔥 2D Heatmap Animation (Kronecker‑sum Laplacian vs CNN)
You already have the scaffold for  — that’s the 2D version where the left panel shows classical diffusion and the right panel shows a CNN surrogate. That’s the visual comparison piece.

🎯 How They Fit Together
• 	 → shows basic tensor ops + autograd (bridge from tensors → ML).
• 	 → shows 2D PDE vs CNN surrogate (bridge from classical PDE → ML surrogate).
Together, they give you:
1. 	The fundamentals (tensor math + gradients).
2. 	The applied demo (heat equation vs ML).
